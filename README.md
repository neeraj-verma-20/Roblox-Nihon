The project aims to help creators ship better games while following platform rules and best practices.

Core goals
- Provide clear, tested modules for common Roblox needs.
- Help teams prototype UI and gameplay systems fast.
- Offer safe, ethical guidance for debugging and testing.
- Ship tools that integrate with CI and local test servers.

Badges
- Stable release tracking: [Releases](https://github.com/neeraj-verma-20/Roblox-Nihon/releases)
- Build status: use GitHub Actions in repo
- License: MIT

Why use this toolkit
--------------------
Roblox developers face repeated patterns: UI, network optimization, state sync, and test automation. This toolkit focuses on those patterns and provides focused code that you can audit, extend, and test.

Benefits
- Clear APIs you can read and test.
- Utility modules that reduce boilerplate.
- Hooks for profiling and telemetry in dev builds.
- Patterns that work with Roblox Studio and CI.

What this toolkit is not
- It is not a cheats, exploits, or hacking toolkit.
- It does not include instructions to bypass platform rules.
- It supports ethical research and approved security testing only.

Usage examples
--------------
Below are several practical examples that show how to use core modules. Each example keeps logic clear and minimal.

Example: Simple HUD
- Import the UI kit module.
- Create a UI root and attach to PlayerGui.
- Create a status widget that updates on a heartbeat.

Example: Profiling a Frame
- Wrap heavy logic with Profiler.start and Profiler.stop.
- Collect markers to find slow subsystems.
- Save a JSON snapshot and view it in the dashboard.

Example: Unit test for a module
- Mock Roblox services required by the module.
- Run test and assert expected state changes.
- Use snapshots to confirm UI structure.

Example: Simulating lag
- Use networking helpers to introduce packet loss and variable latency.
- Run multiplayer scenarios in DemoExperience.
- Verify prediction and reconciliation logic.

API reference
-------------
The repo contains detailed API docs under /docs/api. The APIs keep names and behavior predictable.

Sample API summaries

- start(id: string): void
- mark(id: string): void
- stop(id: string): ProfilerResult
- report(format?: 'json'|'text'): string

ReliableEvent
- new(name: string): ReliableEvent
- send(target: Player|All, payload: table): boolean
- onReceived(handler: function): Connection

UI

  - Add unit tests to validate core logic.
- Profile early and often
  - Use profiler snapshots to track regressions.
- Isolate external dependencies
  - Mock them for unit tests to avoid flakiness.
- Limit client privileges
  - Do not rely on client data for authoritative decisions.

Acknowledgements
----------------
Thanks to the community for feedback and contributions. Many patterns draw on common Roblox development practice and public resources.

Appendix: Example code snippets
-------------------------------
Here are short, safe snippets that show the style and approach. These examples avoid platform-sensitive instructions.

Example: Using Profiler
- Profiler.start("update-loop")
- ...work...
- Profiler.stop("update-loop")
- Profiler.report("text")

Example: Creating a simple UI component
- local Button = UI.Component.create("Button", { text = "Click" })
- Button.onClick(function()
    print("Button clicked")
  end)

Example: ReliableEvent usage
- local ev = ReliableEvent.new("ChatMessage")
- ev.send(player, { text = "Hello" })

These examples show intent and API style. See docs for full signatures.
